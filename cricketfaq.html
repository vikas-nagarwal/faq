              Cricket is a team sport played with a bat and ball, where two
              teams of eleven players each compete to score runs. The game is
              typically played on a circular or oval field with a 22-yard-long
              rectangular pitch at the center. Each team takes turns to bat and
              bowl. The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and
              running between two sets of wickets, while the bowling team tries
              to dismiss the batsmen by hitting the wickets with the ball or
              catching the ball before it hits the ground. Matches can last a
              few hours (in Twenty20) to five days (in Test cricket), depending
              on the format.

              A cricket match is usually divided into innings, where each team
              takes turns to bat and bowl. The primary objective for the batting
              team is to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball and
              running between two sets of wickets or by hitting boundaries. The
              team that is batting first sets a target score, which the opposing
              team then attempts to surpass in their innings. During their time
              in the field, the bowling team’s goal is to restrict the batting
              team's scoring and dismiss the batsmen.

              The basic rules involve scoring runs by hitting the ball and
              running between wickets, getting out by being dismissed, and
              bowling to restrict runs. Each team must adhere to fielding
              restrictions, such as the number of fielders allowed in specific
              areas. Additionally, the bowler must deliver the ball within legal
              guidelines to avoid penalties like no-balls or wides. The match
              progresses through a series of overs, and teams must strategize
              their batting and bowling tactics to outperform their opponents.

              A wicket is a set of three stumps and two bails at each end of the
              pitch, and it’s the target for the bowler. The primary objective
              of the bowler is to hit the stumps or force the batsman to make
              mistakes that lead to dismissals. When the ball hits the wicket
              and dislodges the bails, the batsman is considered out.
              Additionally, wickets play a crucial role in determining the field
              placements and strategies used by both the batting and bowling
              teams.

              The main formats are Test cricket (5 days), One Day Internationals
              (50 overs per side), and Twenty20 (20 overs per side). Test
              cricket is the traditional format with a full day of play,
              allowing for in-depth strategies and endurance. One Day
              Internationals offer a limited overs format that emphasizes quick
              scoring and tactical play. Twenty20 matches are the shortest
              format, featuring explosive batting and high-paced action, making
              it a favorite for shorter, high-energy games.

              A run is scored when the batsmen successfully run between the
              wickets after hitting the ball. Each completed run involves both
              batsmen running to the opposite wickets, and multiple runs can be
              scored in a single hit depending on the ball's placement. Runs are
              also awarded when the ball reaches the boundary for four or six
              runs, depending on whether it touches the ground before crossing
              the boundary line.

              A bowler is a player who delivers the ball to the batsman, while a
              batsman is a player who tries to hit the ball to score runs. The
              bowler’s goal is to get the batsman out through various types of
              deliveries, such as fast, spin, or swing. The batsman’s objective
              is to defend the wickets and score runs by hitting the ball
              effectively.

              A catch is taken when a fielder catches the ball before it touches
              the ground after being hit by the batsman. It is a crucial way to

              coordination. If a catch is taken, the batsman is out and must
              leave the field.

              An over consists of six consecutive deliveries bowled by the same
              bowler. After an over is completed, a different bowler takes over
              from the opposite end of the pitch. Overs are a fundamental unit
              of measurement in limited-overs cricket formats like One Day
              Internationals and Twenty20.

              LBW stands for "Leg Before Wicket," a dismissal where the batsman
              is out if the ball hits their body before hitting the wicket. The
              decision is made if the ball would have hit the stumps had it not
              been intercepted by the batsman's body. This rule aims to prevent
              players from using their body to block the ball and unfairly

              A boundary is when the batsman hits the ball to the edge of the
              field, scoring four runs if it touches the ground before the
              boundary or six runs if it crosses the boundary without touching
              the ground.
